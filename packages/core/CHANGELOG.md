# [next]

**The library has been rewritten from scratch.**

If you want to still use the old behaviour, you can by calling the `serialize` method in the reflected module node:

```typescript
import { ModuleNode, Module } from '@ts-ast-parser/core';

///////////////
// BEFORE
///////////////

const beforeReflectedNodes: Module[] = parseFromFiles(['...']);

////////////////
// AFTER
///////////////

// Same applies for `parseFromGlob`
const afterReflectedNodes: ModuleNode[] = parseFromFiles(['...']);
// const afterReflectedNode: ModuleNode = parseFromSource(`....`);

// Converts the array of `ModuleNode` to `Module`.
// A `Module` is a plain old javascript object without methods, only read-only properties.
const serializedNodes: Module[] = afterReflectedNodes.map(node => node.serialize());
```

Make sure to check what a [`ModuleNode`](./src/nodes/module-node.ts) is before working with it.

Be aware of the breaking changes listed below.

### Features

* The constraints defined in a type parameter will be reflected.
* TypeScript versions `5.0` and `5.1` are supported
* Drop support for Node `14.x`

### Bug Fixes

* Reflect imports with side effects (example: `import './foo.js'`).
* Imports with different kinds weren't reflected correctly (example: `import Foo, { bar } from './foo'`).
* The type and name of a parameter in an index signature wasn't being reflected correctly.
* Getters and Setters (property accessors) were not being reflected when defined inside an interface.
* Class expressions used as initializers in variable declarations weren't being reflected.

### ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes

* The field `type` in the Imports and Exports nodes has been renamed to `kind` for consistency with the same field in 
  the declaration node.
* Now all the fields `kind` (including the new one in the imports and exports) are capitalized.
* The functions `parseFromFiles` and `parseFromGlob` now return an array of instances of `ModuleNode`. 
* The function `parseFromSource` returns an instance of `ModuleNode`.
* The field `members` in the `Interface` and `Class` nodes has been split into `properties`, `staticProperties`, 
  `methods` and `staticMethods`. 
* The package `@ts-ast-parser/readers` has been deleted. There is no need for this packages as now all the 
  functionalities are already included in the package `@ts-ast-parser/core`.
* The field `value` in a `NamedParameter` has been renamed to `default`.
* The field `isTypeOnly` in imports and exports has been renamed to `typeOnly`
* The field `isBareModuleSpecifier` in imports has been renamed to `bareModuleSpecifier`

# [0.2.0](https://github.com/jordimarimon/ts-ast-parser/compare/0.1.0...0.2.0) (2022-12-25)

### Bug Fixes

* Reflect star exports and namespace exports
* Support nested namespaces

### Features

* Add references to type definitions
* Support older versions of NodeJS. Now it is supported: `14.20`, `16.x` and `18.x`
* Support older version of TypeScript. Now it is supported: `4.7`, `4.8` and `4.9`. Older versions could be supported 
  in the future.

### ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes

* The property `source` in a `type` has changed to `sources` and is an array instead of an object.
  This property represents all the type definitions that are involved in the type. A type may be composed of
  other types. Example of types that are composed of others are union types, intersection types, array type, etc...

# [0.1.0](https://github.com/jordimarimon/ts-ast-parser/compare/c3366eb7...0.1.0) (2022-11-05)
