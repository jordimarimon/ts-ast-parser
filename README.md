# TypeScript Abstract Syntax Tree Parser

**NOTE: This is still a work in progress**

Simplifies the TypeScript AST generated from the TypeScript compiler to automatically generate documentation.

This library is inspired by the great work done in:

* [Custom Element Manifest](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest)
* [Custom Element Manifest analyser](https://github.com/open-wc/custom-elements-manifest/tree/master/packages/analyzer)

If you're working with custom elements, I recommend you to go check them out.

This library is a more generic approach than the above two to fill the needs outside custom elements.

Other libraries of interest are (each library offers different needs):

* [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc)
* [JSDoc To Markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown)
* [Better docs](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/better-docs)
* [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/)
* [TSDoc](https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc)
* [Type Doc](https://typedoc.org/)
* [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/)
* [TS Docs gen](https://github.com/SimplrJS/ts-docs-gen)
