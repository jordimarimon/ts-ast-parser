# TypeScript Abstract Syntax Tree Parser

Simplifies the TypeScript AST generated from the TypeScript compiler to automatically generate documentation.

This library is inspired by the great work done in:

* [Custom Element Manifest](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements-manifest)
* [Custom Element Manifest analyser](https://github.com/open-wc/custom-elements-manifest/tree/master/packages/analyzer)

If you're working with custom elements, I recommend you to go check them out.

This library is a more generic approach thant the above two to fill the needs outside custom elements.
